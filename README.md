A tool for helping run Discovery as part of a Behaviour Driven Development based workflow, using Example Mapping

Very small start for now. 

Feel free to join the [Community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/discoinferno-group/shared_invite/zt-2p2yabmc3-ii6TGP1a4p5YBCyaPT3RwQ).

* Areas that need addressing : 
- I need to set up Github Actions so that we have Branch specific execution, reporting to Branch specific Cucumber report collections
- I need to do some Discovery sessions to figure out what to address first and how it may be approached
- I need to write some scenarios and then build software to meet those behaviours

Anyone who wants to help with any of that, feel free to get on the Slack community and contribute.
